int Particle::status()  
status code. The status code includes information on how a particle was produced, i.e. where in the program execution it was inserted into the event record, and why. It also tells whether the particle is still present or not. It does not tell how a particle disappeared, whether by a decay, a shower branching, a hadronization process, or whatever, but this is implicit in the status code of its daughter(s). The basic scheme is:

    status = +- (10 * i + j)
    + : still remaining particles
    - : decayed/branched/fragmented/... and not remaining
    i = 1 - 9 : stage of event generation inside PYTHIA
    i = 10 -19 : reserved for future expansion
    i >= 20 : free for add-on programs
    j = 1 - 9 : further specification

In detail, the list of used or foreseen status codes is:

    11 - 19 : beam particles
        11 : the event as a whole
        12 : incoming beam
        13 : incoming beam-inside-beam (e.g. gamma inside e)
        14 : outgoing elastically scattered
        15 : outgoing diffractively scattered
        
    21 - 29 : particles of the hardest subprocess
        21 : incoming
        22 : intermediate (intended to have preserved mass)
        23 : outgoing
        24 : outgoing, nonperturbatively kicked out in diffraction
        
    31 - 39 : particles of subsequent subprocesses
        31 : incoming
        32 : intermediate (intended to have preserved mass)
        33 : outgoing
        34 : incoming that has already scattered
        
    41 - 49 : particles produced by initial-state-showers
        41 : incoming on spacelike main branch
        42 : incoming copy of recoiler
        43 : outgoing produced by a branching
        44 : outgoing shifted by a branching
        45 : incoming rescattered parton, with changed kinematics owing to ISR in the mother system (cf. status 34)
        46 : incoming copy of recoiler when this is a rescattered parton (cf. status 42)
        47 : a W or Z gauge boson produced in the shower evolution
        
    51 - 59 : particles produced by final-state-showers
        51 : outgoing produced by parton branching
        52 : outgoing copy of recoiler, with changed momentum
        53 : copy of recoiler when this is incoming parton, with changed momentum
        54 : copy of a recoiler, when in the initial state of a different system from the radiator
        55 : copy of a recoiler, when in the final state of a different system from the radiator
        56 : a W or Z gauge boson produced in a shower branching (special case of 51)
        
    61 - 69 : particles produced by beam-remnant treatment
        61 : incoming subprocess particle with primordial kT included
        62 : outgoing subprocess particle with primordial kT included
        63 : outgoing beam remnant
        
    71 - 79 : partons in preparation of hadronization process
        71 : copied partons to collect into contiguous colour singlet
        72 : copied recoiling singlet when ministring collapses to one hadron and momentum has to be reshuffled
        73 : combination of very nearby partons into one
        74 : combination of two junction quarks (+ nearby gluons) to a diquark
        75 : gluons split to decouple a junction-antijunction pair
        76 : partons with momentum shuffled to decouple a junction-antijunction pair
        77 : temporary opposing parton when fragmenting first two strings in to junction (should disappear again)
        78 : temporary combined diquark end when fragmenting last string in to junction (should disappear again)
        
    81 - 89 : primary hadrons produced by hadronization process
        81 : from ministring into one hadron
        82 : from ministring into two hadrons
        83, 84 : from normal string (the difference between the two is technical, whether fragmented off from the top of the string system or from the bottom,
                 useful for debug only)
        85, 86 : primary produced hadrons in junction fragmentation of the first two string legs in to the junction, in order of treatment
        
    91 - 99 : particles produced in decay process, or by Bose-Einstein effects
        91 : normal decay products
        92 : decay products after oscillation B0 ↔ B0bar or B_s0 ↔ B_s0bar
        93, 94 : decay handled by external program, normally or with oscillation
        99 : particles with momenta shifted by Bose-Einstein effects (not a proper decay, but bookkept as an 1 → 1 such, 
             happening after decays of short-lived resonances but before decays of longer-lived particles)
             
    101 - 109 : particles in the handling of R-hadron production and decay, i.e. long-lived (or stable) particles containing a very heavy flavour
        101 : when a string system contains two such long-lived particles, the system is split up by the production of a new q-qbar pair 
              (bookkept as decay chains that seemingly need not conserve flavour etc., but do when considered together)
        102 : partons rearranged from the long-lived particle end to prepare for fragmentation from this end
        103 : intermediate "half-R-hadron" formed when a colour octet particle (like the gluino) has been fragmented on one side, but not yet on the other
        104 : an R-hadron
        105 : partons or particles formed together with the R-hadron during the fragmentation treatment
        106 : subdivision of an R-hadron into its flavour content, with momentum split accordingly, in preparation of the decay of the heavy new particle, 
              if it is unstable
        107 : two temporary leftover gluons joined into one in the formation of a gluino-gluon R-hadron.
        
    111 - 199 : reserved for future expansion
    201 - : free to be used by anybody
